    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Our team at <a href="http://prosper.community/">Prosper</a> has created this platform in order to centralize all the projects doing meaningful work within the refugee crisis.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      We are currently collaborating and sharing data with a number of other initiatives. If youâ€™d like to join our team, or have refugee-related project data to share, please <a href="mailto:john@prosper.community">send us and email</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Process</h3>
    <p>
      After a six week period of intensive research, our team finally decided that this platform was the best way for us to make a scalable, sustainable and significant impact on the refugee crisis. Here is a basic outline of the design and development process we'd like to employ to realize the impact we've envisioned.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1. Seed The Database</h4>
    <p>
      We're working with a global team of volunteers to seed our database with projects of the refugee crisis that we know are doing great work. Many of our team members are working with refugees on the ground and have witnessed some of these projects first hand. We've intereviewed dozens of project founders and want to bring their initiatives to light so that they can help more refugees and receive the support they need from volunteers and funders.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2. Create Partnerships</h4>
    <p>
      We've identified several other initiatives which are centralizing projects of the refugee crisis. We've reached out to them and are hoping to share data, and hopefully centralize our efforts so that we can have one global, central repository for the refugee crisis.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://refugeeboard.de/">RefugeeBoard.de</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.for-good.io/">For-Good.io</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.socialprohub.org">SocialProHub.org</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://mera-europe.org/">Mapping Europe Refugees' Aid</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It doesn't matter what the platform is called, who gets the credit, or what technology we use. For us, we simply care about solving the problems created by having all of the refugee crisis intiatives scattered across the web.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3. Analyze Data</h4>
    <p>
      We're teaming up with a data-driving initiative supported by UNHCR called <a href="http://projecthive.nyc/">Project Hive</a> to analyze our data and draw conclusions about the best ways to display this data through a user interface. They've got a great team of data scientists and we are looking forward to working with them once we've reached a critical mass with our database and can start combing for insights.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4. Implement Design</h4>
    <p>
      Once we have a clear perspective on the best ways to portray our database through a user interface, we'll scaffold an open-source web application that is 100% free to use (and always will be) so that <strong>refugees</strong> <strong>volunteers</strong> and <strong>donors</strong> can find the projects that meet their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're passionate about human-centered design so that real human needs stay at the center of everything we do. Technology is a great tool, but when it isn't designed to meet the real problems that people experience, it can create more problems and make our lives more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are humbled to have an expert team of human-centered designers who have work at top agencies and companies around the world.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5. Launch, Test, Iterate</h4>
    <p>
      We're hoping to launch our platform at a very early stage in order to begin testing with real users. We're using a data-driven process to measure our application's ability to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Match refugees with projects that meet their needs</li>
      <li>Connect volunteers with projects that need their help</li>
      <li>Encourage donors to support projects that deserve their funding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We know that this iterative process requires a lot of skilled labor and that's why we are always open for more contributors to join our community. If you're keen to learn more, please feel free to check out our website: <a href="http://prosper.community/">Prosper.Community</a> and request and invite to join our team.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>
      As we mentioned above, we're passionate about employing a human-centered design process to keep real human needs at the heart of everything we do. We're a people-first organization, but there are a few other values that drive our community forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've invested a lot of time and energy documenting how we do what we do and <em>why</em> on our <a href="http://prosper.community/playbook.html">Playbook</a>. We'd be honored if you'd take a look and let us know what you think.
